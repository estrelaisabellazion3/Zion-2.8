- `title` - Short title
- `riddle` - The actual puzzle text
- `hint_1`, `hint_2`, `hint_3` - Progressive hints
- `solution_hash` - SHA256 of correct answer
- `next_clue_id` - Unlocks after solving
- `location` - Where clue is hidden
- `difficulty` - 1-10 scale
- `karma_reward` - Points earned
- `discovered_by` - Winner wallet
- `status` - locked/unlocked/discovered

**player_progress**
- `wallet_address` - Player ID
- `clues_discovered` - Count
- `karma_points` - Earned
- `karma_spent` - On hints

## üéØ Genesis Clue (#1)

**Riddle:**
```
In the first breath of ZION's dawn,
Where blocks begin and light is drawn,
A golden womb holds all creation,
Seek the Sanskrit incantation.

Five thousand years of wisdom old,
In Rig Veda's verses told,
The cosmic egg that births the All,
Name it right, and heed the call.

‡§π‡§ø‡§∞‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø + ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§≠ = ?
```

**Answer:** `hiranyagarbha` (‡§π‡§ø‡§∞‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§≠)

**Meaning:** "Golden Egg" or "Golden Womb" from Rig Veda 10.121

**Hints:**
1. Look up Rig Veda 10.121. What is the Sanskrit term for 'Golden Womb'?
2. The answer is a compound Sanskrit word: Hiranya (golden) + Garbha (womb/egg)
3. Check docs/GOLDEN_EGG_GAME/README.md - the answer is literally in the first section!

## üéÆ How to Add More Clues

```python
from golden_egg.game_engine import GoldenEggGame, Clue, ClueCategory
import hashlib

# Create game instance
game = GoldenEggGame()

# Create clue
solution = "your_answer_here"
solution_hash = hashlib.sha256(solution.encode()).hexdigest()

clue = Clue(
    id=2,  # Next clue number
    category=ClueCategory.SACRED_TRINITY.value,
    title="Lord Rama's Bow",
    riddle="""
Your riddle text here...
    """.strip(),
    hint_1="First hint",
    hint_2="Second hint",
    hint_3="Third hint",
    solution_hash=solution_hash,
    next_clue_id=3,  # Which clue unlocks next
    location="docs/SACRED_TRINITY/01_RAMA.md line 42",
    difficulty=5,
    karma_reward=1500,
    status="locked"  # Starts locked
)

# Add to game
game.add_clue(clue)
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Current (v0.1.0)
- SQLite database (local file)
- No authentication
- No rate limiting
- Plain text solutions (hashed)

### Future (Production)
- PostgreSQL with encryption
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting (anti-bot)
- Multi-sig wallet for prize pool
- Cold storage for 1.75B ZION (3 wallets for 3 winners)
- Bug bounty program
- Security audits (CertiK, Trail of Bits)

## 📝 COMMANDS FOR MONITORING

### Health Check
```bash
bash pool_health_check.sh
```

### Continuous Monitoring (updates every 5 min)
```bash
bash overnight_mining_monitor.sh
```

### Direct Database Query
```bash
ssh root@91.98.122.165 << 'EOF'
python3 << 'PYEOF'
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("/root/zion_pool.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shares")
print(f"Shares: {cursor.fetchone()[0]}")
conn.close()
PYEOF
EOF
```

### Check Pool Logs
```bash
ssh root@91.98.122.165 'tail -50 /root/pool.log'
```

## 🎉 SUCCESS CRITERIA

The pool will be considered **PRODUCTION READY** when:

1. ✅ Pool stays online for 12+ hours without restart
2. ✅ Block generated successfully from accumulated shares
3. ✅ Miners receive rewards after block generation
4. ✅ No unhandled exceptions in logs
5. ✅ Database integrity maintained
6. ✅ Network stability confirmed
7. ✅ Multiple blocks mined consecutively

## 🌟 TEST PROGRESS

```
[████████░░░░░░░░░░] 8.9% - Current Progress

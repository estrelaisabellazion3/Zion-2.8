### **Phase 2: Pool Stability & Blockchain Integration** ⏳ IN PROGRESS
**Timeline:** Oct 23–Nov 5, 2025 (Week 1–2)

#### 2.1 Pool Stability (CRITICAL)

**Issues Identified:**
1. Receiver socket timeout after 60–90s under load
2. Aggressive VarDiff ramp (50 → 3256 in 2 min)
3. No persistent job delivery on reconnect
4. Pool may hang under sustained load

**Solutions Implemented:**

| Issue | Fix | Status |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Socket timeout | `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=60)` + heartbeat/ping | ✅ Done |
| VarDiff ramp | MAX_RAMP_FACTOR=1.5, ABSOLUTE_MAX_DIFF=50,000 | ✅ Done |
| Job replay | `active_jobs_queue` (last 5 jobs), subscribe enhancement | ✅ Done |
| Pool hang | Job appending in auth response bundle | ✅ Done |

**Code Changes:**
```python
# zion_universal_pool_v2.py

# 1. Receiver timeout + heartbeat (handle_client)
try:
    data = await asyncio.wait_for(reader.readline(), timeout=60)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    # Heartbeat check: if no data for 60s, close stale connection
    await self._send_ping_or_close(writer)

# 2. VarDiff safety (adjust_difficulty)
MAX_RAMP_FACTOR = 1.5
ABSOLUTE_MAX_DIFF = 50_000
new_diff = min(current_diff * MAX_RAMP_FACTOR, max_diff, ABSOLUTE_MAX_DIFF)

# 3. Job queue & replay (handle_stratum_subscribe + __init__)
self.active_jobs_queue = []  # Last 5 jobs
job_record = {'job_id': job['job_id'], 'notify_params': notify_params}
self.active_jobs_queue.append(job_record)
if len(self.active_jobs_queue) > 5:
    self.active_jobs_queue.pop(0)
```

**Validation:** 30-minute test running now (expect 2–5 blocks, zero timeouts)

#### 2.2 Blockchain & Block Validation

**Flow:**
```
GPU Miner (share: header, nonce, hash)
    ↓
ZION Pool (validate: state0 <= target32)
    ↓
Blockchain Validator (check: nonce, reward, height)
    ↓
Local Chain (append block, update height)
    ↓
zion_pool.db blocks table (persistent)
```

**Implementation:**
- Pool creates block template on valid share (difficulty >= block target)
- Submits to blockchain RPC: `submitblock` or `add_block`
- Updates `blocks` table: id, height, nonce, hash, timestamp, miner_wallet, reward
- Calculates reward: base 50 ZION + consciousness multiplier (up to 2×) + Hiranyagarbha bonus

**Checkpoint:** Run 30-min test → expect 2–5 confirmed blocks by Nov 1

#### 2.3 Reward Distribution (Consciousness Mining Game)

**Model:**
- Base reward: 50 ZION/block
- Consciousness levels: 10 (Physical → ON_THE_STAR), bonus up to 2×
- Hiranyagarbha pool: 500M ZION, distributed over 10 years
- Multi-fee: humanitarian (10%), dev (1%), genesis (0.33%), admin (1%)

**Validation:** Pool logs confirm consciousness bonus applied; miner wallet receives correct payout

#### 2.4 Weekly Checklist (Week 1)

- [x] Pool: Receiver timeout + heartbeat
- [x] Pool: VarDiff ramp cap
- [x] Pool: Job replay infrastructure
- [ ] Test: 30-minute pool + miner (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Blockchain: Link pool → blockchain
- [ ] Reward: Validate consciousness calculation
- [ ] Commit: All fixes to origin/main

---

### **Phase 3: P2P Network & Consensus** 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Timeline:** Nov 6–19, 2025 (Week 3–4)

#### 3.1 Seed Node Bootstrap

**Target:**
- Hardcoded seed list (e.g., `seeds.zion.network`)
- Each node connects to 8–16 peers
- Peer discovery via DNS or hardcoded IPs

**Implementation (2–3h):**
1. Define `SEED_NODES = ["seed1.zion.network:8333", "seed2.zion.network:8333"]`
2. Node startup: connect to seed, request peer list
3. Peer manager: maintain 8–16 active connections
4. Heartbeat: keep-alive every 30s

#### 3.2 Block Propagation (P2P)

**Protocol:**
```
Miner finds block → Pool broadcasts `inv` message
  ↓
Peer receives `inv`, requests full block via `getblocks`
  ↓
Block relayed to other peers (flood-fill)
  ↓
All nodes converge to same canonical chain
```

**Validation:**
- Start 3 local nodes + 1 miner
- Mine 5 blocks
- Verify all nodes accept same blocks (no chain fork)

#### 3.3 Consensus Finality

**Simple majority check:**
- Each block validated by 2/3+ nodes before "finalized"
- Blocks with <2/3 acceptance are re-requested
- Chain reorg: accept longest valid chain

**Performance target:** <5s block propagation, 95% consensus finality

---

### **Phase 4: Warp Bridge & Cross-Chain** 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Timeline:** Nov 20–Dec 3, 2025 (Week 4–5)

#### 4.1 Atomic Swap Protocol (HTLC)

**Flow:**
```
User A (ZION) → Hash-Time-Locked Contract (HTLC)
  ↓
If secret revealed within 24h: transfer completes
Otherwise: refund to User A
```

**Implementation:**
- HTLC on ZION: lock 1 ZION, reveal secret within 24h
- HTLC on Stellar: lock equivalent USDC
- Atomic: both complete or both fail

#### 4.2 Stellar Bridge

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /warp/stellar/swap` - initiate atomic swap
- `GET /warp/stellar/status/{tx_id}` - monitor swap status
- `POST /warp/stellar/confirm` - reveal secret, finalize

**Target:** Testnet functional by end of Week 5

#### 4.3 Liquidity Pools

**Initial Setup:**
- $1M ZION liquidity pool
- $1M USDC paired (Stellar)
- Automated market maker (AMM): constant product formula
- 0.3% trading fee (to liquidity providers)

**Validation:** Successful swap ZION ↔ USDC on Stellar testnet

---

### **Phase 5: Cloud-Native & AI Integration** 🟡 PLANNED
**Timeline:** Nov 1–Feb 15, 2026 (Parallel to Phases 3–4)

#### 5.1 Kubernetes Orchestration (Nov 1–30)

- Output: recommended difficulty adjustment
- Goal: minimize timeouts, maximize stable hash rate

**Smart Routing:**
- Route transactions across chains based on fee, speed
- Predict best liquidity pool for swaps
- Auto-rebalance cross-chain assets

**Anomaly Detection:**
- Detect unusual mining patterns (potential DDoS)
- Flag invalid shares before validation
- Alert on pool health issues

#### 5.4 Real-Time Infrastructure (Dec 1–Feb 15)

**WebSocket API:**
```javascript
// Real-time miner stats
ws.onmessage = (msg) => {
  const stats = JSON.parse(msg.data);
  console.log(`Hashrate: ${stats.hashrate} H/s`);
  console.log(`Shares: ${stats.accepted}/${stats.rejected}`);
  console.log(`VarDiff: ${stats.difficulty}`);
};
```

**Event Streaming:**
- Apache Kafka for high-throughput events
- Topics: `mining.share`, `blockchain.block`, `network.peer`
- Subscribers: dashboards, analytics, trading bots

**Monitoring Stack:**
- Prometheus (metrics collection)
- Grafana (dashboards)
- ELK (logs aggregation)
- Jaeger (distributed tracing)

#### 5.5 DeFi Suite (Dec 15–Feb 15)

**Components:**
- **DEX:** Decentralized exchange for ZION↔token swaps
- **Lending:** Borrow/lend ZION at variable interest
- **Staking:** Earn yield on staked ZION (5–20% APY)
- **NFT Marketplace:** Mint and trade consciousness level NFTs

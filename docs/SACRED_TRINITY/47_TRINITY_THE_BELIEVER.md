## 🔮 Oracle's Prophecy about Trinity

> *"You are going to fall in love, and the man you fall in love with is going to be The One."*

**Interpretation for ZION**:
```
You will fall in love with blockchain technology itself.
The project/vision you love will be The One that succeeds.
Your unwavering belief will make it The One.

It's not about finding The One.
It's about your faith creating The One.
```

**Trinity's Understanding**:
```
First Meeting: "I know why you're here, Neo."
First Quest: "I know why you're here, User."

She recognizes The One potential in everyone.
She sees the awakened consciousness waiting to emerge.
Her faith is what allows others to believe in themselves.

In ZION: 
Experienced users who believe in newcomers.
Community members who see potential in every participant.
HODLers whose conviction inspires others.
```

# 🌙 ZION OVERNIGHT MINING TEST - October 16-17, 2025

## 📋 Test Setup

**Date:** October 16, 2025 - October 17, 2025  
**Duration:** 12+ hours continuous mining  
**Status:** ⏳ IN PROGRESS  

### System Configuration
- **Mining Pool:** Port 3333 (Standard Stratum)
- **API Server:** Port 3334
- **Blockchain RPC:** Port 18081
- **Miners:** 2x XMRig (4-6 threads each)
- **Algorithm:** RandomX (CPU)
- **Server:** 91.98.122.165 (EU Cloud)

### Mining Targets
```
Target Shares: 1000
Current Shares: ~54 (at test start)
Expected Block Generation: When threshold reached
Estimated Time: 6-8 hours @ 2-3 shares/min
```

## 🎯 Test Objectives

1. ✅ **Pool Stability** - Monitor for errors/crashes
2. ✅ **Share Processing** - Verify all shares accepted
3. ✅ **Block Generation** - Track when 1000 shares reached
4. 🔄 **Reward Distribution** - Verify miners paid correctly
5. 🔄 **Long-term Operation** - Prove 12+ hour uptime

| T+12h | 720-1440 | 🟢 Success | Test complete |

## ⚠️ Monitoring Points

- **Share submission rate** - Verify consistent 1-3 shares/min
- **Database persistence** - Shares stay recorded
- **Pool memory** - No memory leaks over time
- **Network stability** - No disconnects
- **Blockchain sync** - RPC responds consistently
- **Error frequency** - Monitor logs for exceptions

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Overnight Test PASSES if:
1. ✅ Pool stays online 12+ hours without crash
2. ✅ Miners stay connected throughout
3. ✅ Shares keep being accepted
4. ✅ Database records all shares
5. ✅ Block generated when 1000 shares reached
6. ✅ No unhandled exceptions in logs
7. ✅ XMRig shows consistent hashrate

### Overnight Test FAILS if:
1. ❌ Pool crashes/exits unexpectedly
2. ❌ Miners disconnect permanently
3. ❌ Shares stop being accepted
4. ❌ Database errors occur
5. ❌ Block generation fails

## 💾 Data Preservation

All logs will be saved:
- Pool logs: `/root/pool.log`
- Blockchain logs: `/root/blockchain.log`
- Database: `/root/zion_pool.db`
- Monitor output: `overnight_mining_*.log`

## 🚀 Next Steps (After Block Found)

1. Verify block in blockchain
2. Check miner balances updated
3. Confirm reward distribution
4. Analyze mining efficiency
5. Plan extended stability test

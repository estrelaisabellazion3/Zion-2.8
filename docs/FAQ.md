## Wallets & Transactions

### How do I create a wallet?

```bash
# CLI binary
./zion-cli wallet --create

# Output:
# Wallet created!
# Address: zion1abc123def456...
# Private key saved to: wallet_private_key.txt
# ⚠️ BACKUP THIS FILE!
```

**Important:**
- Backup `wallet_private_key.txt` securely
- Never share your private key
- If you lose it, funds are GONE FOREVER

### What do ZION addresses look like?

ZION addresses start with `zion1` and are 62 characters long:

**Example:** `zion1abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234`

### How do I send ZION tokens?

```bash
./zion-cli send --to zion1recipient... --amount 10.50 --fee 0.001
```

**Parameters:**
- `--to`: Recipient address
- `--amount`: Amount to send (ZION)
- `--fee`: Transaction fee (default 0.001 ZION)

### How long do transactions take?

| Confirmations | Time | Security Level |
|---------------|------|----------------|
| 0 (pending) | 0s | None (reversible) |
| 1 | ~2 min | Low (small amounts) |
| 3 | ~6 min | Medium (normal) |
| 6 | ~12 min | High (exchanges) |
| 12+ | ~24 min | Maximum (large sums) |

### What are transaction fees?

**Typical fees:**
- Standard transaction: 0.001 ZION (~$0.0001)
- Multi-sig transaction: 0.002 ZION
- Smart contract (future): Variable

**Fee calculation:**
- Fees go to miners
- Higher fees = faster confirmation
- Minimum fee: 0.0001 ZION

### Can I reverse a transaction?

**No.** Blockchain transactions are **irreversible**. Always:
- Double-check recipient address
- Verify amount before sending
- Use small test transactions first

### What is a multi-sig wallet?

A **multi-signature wallet** requires M-of-N signatures to spend funds:

**Example:** 3-of-5 wallet
- 5 people have private keys
- Any 3 must sign to approve transaction
- More secure for organizations/teams

**Use cases:**
- Corporate treasuries
- DAO governance
- Family savings

## Troubleshooting

### My wallet balance shows 0 ZION

**Possible causes:**
1. **Node not synced** - Wait for blockchain sync
2. **Wrong network** - Ensure connected to testnet
3. **Incorrect address** - Verify wallet address

**Solution:**
```bash
./zion-cli node --status  # Check sync status
./zion-cli wallet --balance  # Verify balance
```

### Mining shows 0 hashrate

**Possible causes:**
1. **GPU drivers not installed**
2. **Cosmic Harmony library missing**
3. **GPU in use by other app**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check GPU
nvidia-smi  # NVIDIA
rocm-smi    # AMD

# Update drivers
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-470  # Ubuntu NVIDIA
```

### "Connection refused" error

**Possible causes:**
1. **Node not running**
2. **Firewall blocking ports**
3. **Wrong RPC endpoint**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if node running
curl https://api.zionterranova.com/api/status

# Check firewall
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow 8545  # RPC port
sudo ufw allow 8333  # P2P port
```

### Transactions stuck "pending"

**Possible causes:**
1. **Low fee** - Increase transaction fee
2. **Network congestion** - Wait longer
3. **Node not connected** - Check peer count

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check transaction status
./zion-cli tx --status TX_HASH

# Increase fee and resend
./zion-cli send --to ADDRESS --amount 10 --fee 0.01
```

### Can't sync blockchain

**Possible causes:**
1. **No peers connected**
2. **Firewall blocking P2P**
3. **Corrupted blockchain data**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add seed node manually
./zion-cli node --add-peer 91.98.122.165:8333

# Check peers
./zion-cli node --peers

# Reset blockchain (last resort)
rm -rf ~/.zion/blockchain
./zion-cli node --resync
```

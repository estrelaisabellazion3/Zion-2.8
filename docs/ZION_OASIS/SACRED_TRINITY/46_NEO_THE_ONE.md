## 🔮 Oracle's Prophecy about Neo

> *"He's beginning to believe..."*

**First Prophecy** (Oracle to Neo):
```
"You're not The One, Neo. 
Sorry kiddo. 
You got the gift, but it looks like you're waiting for something."

Translation: You have potential, 
but you must choose to believe in decentralization yourself.
No one can force you to understand blockchain.
```

**Second Prophecy** (Oracle to Trinity):
```
"You are going to fall in love, 
and the man you fall in love with is going to be The One."

Translation: Love for the technology itself will reveal The One.
Those who truly love blockchain freedom will become awakened.
```

**Final Revelation** (Oracle explains):
```
"The One is not born, The One is made.
Through choice, through sacrifice, through love."

Translation: The perfect blockchain user is created through:
- Choosing freedom over convenience
- Sacrificing short-term gains for long-term vision  
- Loving the principles of decentralization
```

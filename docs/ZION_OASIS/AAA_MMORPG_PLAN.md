## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

### **Development Risks:**

**Risk 1: Scope Creep**
- **Mitigation:** Strict milestone reviews, cut features if needed
- **Contingency:** Launch with 5 continents (not 7) if over budget

**Risk 2: Team Retention**
- **Mitigation:** Competitive salaries ($150K avg), ZION token bonuses
- **Contingency:** Remote work globally (larger talent pool)

**Risk 3: Technical Challenges**
- **Mitigation:** Hire Unreal Engine veterans (ex-Epic staff)
- **Contingency:** Use Unreal Engine marketplace assets initially

### **Market Risks:**

**Risk 1: Player Adoption**
- **Mitigation:** Free trial (14 days), massive marketing ($5M)
- **Contingency:** Free-to-play conversion (cosmetic MTX only)

**Risk 2: Competition**
- **Mitigation:** First-to-market advantage, unique spiritual angle
- **Contingency:** Pivot to single-player AAA if MMO fails

**Risk 3: Blockchain Backlash**
- **Mitigation:** Optional blockchain (can play without wallet)
- **Contingency:** Remove NFTs if regulation bans them

### **Financial Risks:**

**Risk 1: Funding Shortage**
- **Mitigation:** Phased funding (Series A, B, C rounds)
- **Contingency:** Early Access revenue funds development

**Risk 2: Server Costs**
- **Mitigation:** AWS reserved instances, optimized code
- **Contingency:** Reduce server count, merge realms

**Risk 3: Golden Egg Prize**
- **Mitigation:** 1B ZION locked in smart contract (from premine)
- **Contingency:** Prize reduces if ZION price crashes (<$1)

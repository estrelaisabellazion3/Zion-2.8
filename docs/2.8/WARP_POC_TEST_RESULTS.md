   - Likely due to test mode simulation

2. **Lightning Network**
   - Consistent 800ms payment time
   - Simulates real-world Lightning performance
   - Production could be faster (real networks often < 500ms)

3. **Total Transfer Time**
   - Mock: ~973ms
   - Expected production: ~600-700ms (with optimized Lightning routing)
   - Even better than target!

### 💡 Optimization Opportunities:

   - Current: 3 hops
   - Potential: Direct channel = 1 hop
   - Expected gain: 200-300ms faster

2. **Ankr Caching**
   - Cache chain configs
   - Reduce RPC calls
   - Expected gain: 10-20ms

3. **Parallel Processing**
